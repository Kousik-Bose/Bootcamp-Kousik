            <h2>Review Summary</h2>
            <p>Anik's webpage demonstrates a solid foundation in design principles. However, there is room for improvement in terms of visual impact and usability.</p>

            <h2>EX-1: Fonts</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>
            <p>The font choices are fairly standard, with decent implementation. Improvements in side margins, padding, and line height would enhance the overall design.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>EX-2: Colors</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 6/10</p>
            <p>The color section suffers from navigation issues, as users need to switch between pages to see differences. The color swatch overwhelms users with too many options at once, lacking clear usage explanations.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>EX-3: Icons</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>
            <p>The icon solutions were varied but inconsistent. Solution 1's link was broken, while Solution 2 featured an interactive grid with hover effects. Solution 3 showcased a standard navbar with well-designed buttons.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>EX-4: Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7.5/10</p>
            <p>The image section was well-executed with basic implementations like full-bleed headers and lazy loading. Adding text content alongside images would provide better context.</p>

            <h2>EX-5: Sample Website</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7.5/10</p>
            <p>The medium clone was aesthetically pleasing, but responsiveness could be improved. Element hierarchy, fonts, and icons were well-implemented overall.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>EX-6: Design in Practice</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 6.5/10</p>
            <p>The website reviews lacked CSS design, offering little to critique. Redesigns for the IRCTC and faculty pages were well-organized with minimal clutter and clear navigation.</p>
