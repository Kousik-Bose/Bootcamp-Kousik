            <h2>Review Summary</h2>
            <p>Zoya's webpage demonstrates a solid understanding of design fundamentals, with well-thought-out font choices, color schemes, and layouts. However, adherence to structured templates like CSS Zen Garden could enhance consistency and refine the overall user experience.</p>

            <h2>EX-1: Fonts</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7.5/10</p>
            <p>The font choices are appropriate and enhance readability. However, the lack of implementation of a template structure like CSS Zen Garden detracts from showcasing the impact of fonts in creating a cohesive design. A more deliberate use of spacing and line height could improve readability further.</p>

            <h2>EX-2: Colors</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10</p>
            <p>The color palette is vibrant and consistent, with dark mode receiving particular praise for its balance and visual comfort. The use of gradients in level-3 is commendable, adding depth to the design. Slight improvements in spacing could further enhance the layout's appeal.</p>

            <h2>EX-3: Icons</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
            <p>Icons are used effectively, blending seamlessly with the content. However, the absence of SVG implementation in level-2 limits scalability and clarity across devices. Transitioning to SVG-based icons would significantly improve the design's flexibility.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>EX-4: Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
            <p>The images are well-placed and styled with consistent margins and padding. Adding technical insights such as image resolution and compression techniques would provide users with a deeper understanding of the design choices.</p>

            <h2>EX-5: Sample Website</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10</p>
            <p>The replication of the sample webpage demonstrates excellent attention to detail. However, incorporating long-form content in the article layout would provide a better sense of how the design handles scalability and readability.</p>

            <h2>EX-6: Design in Practice</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10</p>
            <p>The redesign of the selected pages showcases a creative and modern approach. The comparative analysis between Amazon and Flipkart was engaging and insightful. Ensuring the redesign link is readily accessible would add value to the review process.</p>
