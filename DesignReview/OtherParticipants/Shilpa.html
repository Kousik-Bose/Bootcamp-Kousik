            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
            <p>The font choices were effective, especially with the use of the CSS Zen Garden template in Level 1. A consistent application of the template throughout the exercise would enhance clarity and continuity.</p>

            <h2>EX-4: Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>
            <p>The images were presented cleanly but lacked sufficient explanation or context. Providing more details about the image properties and their usage would improve the overall quality.</p>

            <h2>EX-5: Sample Website</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10</p>
            <p>The minimalist article layout was thoughtfully designed, with no distractions and excellent use of spacing. The second website's card-based layout was an excellent touch, combining visuals with concise content effectively.</p>

            <h2>EX-6: Design in Practice</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7.5/10</p>
            <p>The redesign of the IRISET/IRCTC websites showed potential but felt somewhat cluttered. There was little guidance for user navigation. However, the reasoning behind identifying the flaws in the original design was well-articulated.</p>
