            <h2>Review Summary</h2>
            <p>Lakshmi's webpage demonstrates a good understanding of basic design principles but could benefit from improvements in structure and functionality.</p>

            <h2>EX-1: Fonts</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7/10</p>
            <p>The font exercise was satisfactory, but it did not adhere to the CSS Zen Garden template guidelines. Better structuring of the information would improve the exercise.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>EX-2: Colors</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7.5/10</p>
            <p>The color exercise was well-executed, featuring good margins, padding, and font spacing. However, Level 2 functionality was incomplete, as the button did not work.</p>

            <h2>EX-3: Icons</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
            <p>The icons were well-implemented with good color choices. Adding context for the icons would further enhance the presentation.</p>

            <h2>EX-4: Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7.5/10</p>
            <p>The image exercise was good, but more information about the changes and additional image properties would make it better.</p>

            <h2>EX-5: Sample Website</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 7.5/10</p>
            <p>The article layout was visually appealing. Including more content, a date, and additional context for images would improve its effectiveness.</p>

            <h2>EX-6: Design in Practice</h2>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 6/10</p>
            <p>The redesign page link was missing, limiting the ability to provide detailed feedback.</p>
