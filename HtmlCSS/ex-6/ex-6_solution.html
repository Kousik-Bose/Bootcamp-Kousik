            I discovered Daily.dev, and I must say—it’s a fantastic resource for staying updated with all things web development and tech. I had installed it earlier but only now took the time to explore its full potential. The curated blogs and articles are incredibly insightful, offering everything from coding tips to industry news.

            To complement this, I’ve started following a few tech-focused YouTubers who share practical insights, tutorials, and discussions around web development. It’s amazing how much you can learn from a community that’s so passionate about sharing knowledge.
