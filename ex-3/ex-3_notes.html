    <h1>Notes on Exercise 3: WEEK 1</h1>

    
    <p>Working with classless CSS was an eye-opening experience. The goal was to style an HTML page without relying on classes or IDs, pushing us to focus on styling basic elements directly. This approach aligns with the idea of simplicity and minimalism, which is often essential when writing blogs or basic documentation. Additionally, I explored <code>normalize.css</code> and related concepts to start with a clean slate for styling.</p>

    <h2>Level 1: Center-aligning Content</h2>
    <p>To begin, I styled a blog post with a title, subtitle, and paragraph. Using element selectors like <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, and <code>p</code>, I center-aligned the content and added basic margins for readability. The challenge here was ensuring consistency across browsers, which was addressed by using normalize.css to reset default browser styles.</p>

    <h2>Level 2: Enhancing the Blog</h2>
    <p>At this stage, I introduced a list, a blockquote, and an inline code snippet. Styling these elements without classes involved:
        <ul>
            <li>Using <code>ul</code> for the list and adding padding for proper indentation.</li>
            <li>Customizing the <code>blockquote</code> element with italicized text and a subtle border to make it stand out.</li>
            <li>Highlighting <code>inline code</code> with a background color and slight padding for emphasis.</li>
        </ul>
        The challenge was to achieve a visually appealing layout using only basic selectors while maintaining flexibility for content updates.</p>

    <h2>Level 3: Exploring Classless CSS Frameworks</h2>
    <p>Finally, I experimented with classless CSS frameworks like <a href="https://unpkg.com/@picocss/pico@1.*/css/pico.min.css">Pico CSS</a>. These frameworks provide pre-styled elements out-of-the-box, making them perfect for minimal setups. I tested a few options and found the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
        "Classless.de stood out for its clean, modern typography and responsive layout. It balanced aesthetics and functionality without adding complexity."
    </blockquote>
    <p>While these frameworks are convenient, I learned the importance of understanding their limitations. They offer limited customization, and fine-tuning specific elements may still require additional CSS.</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Insights</h2>
    <p>The key challenges during this exercise included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring consistency across browsers without explicitly targeting browser quirks.</li>
       
        <li>Making the layout responsive without predefined classes or IDs.</li>
    </ul>
